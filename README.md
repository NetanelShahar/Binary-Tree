## General Project Description:
A binary tree is a dynamic data structure made up of two-pointed vertices of the same type.

It is customary to call one of the colored heads "Ben Shemali" and the other "Ben Rightist".

It is also customary to call the first point, the one without a vertex pointing to it, 

the "root" of the tree and the vertices that do not point to other vertices of the tree.

### Insert - Receives data, checks if the data already exists in the tree, if not create a new node and put it instead of wright
### Print - Print the tree on demand
### Remove - Delete data from wood if there is and arrange the tree
### Size - Returns the number of nodes in the tree
### Contain - check if the data is already in the tree
### Root - root of a tree returns
### Parent - Returns the node that points to this data
